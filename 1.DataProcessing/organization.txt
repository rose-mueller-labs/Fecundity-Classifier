1. Create 7 datasets
    a. 4-30, 5-1, 5-2
    b. 4-30 & 5-1, 4-30 & 5-2, 5-2 & 5-1
    c. 4-30 & 5-1 & 5-2
    d. Jacob
2. Make the black and white versions of these datasets
3. Train 3 different CNN scripts on the 14 datasets (do this 6 times?)
    a. Save testing tile output metrics:
        (MSE, accuracy)
4. Testing:
    a. 6 times on 5-4
    b. 6 times on CD
    c. 6 times on Alden's CD
5. Run signed ranked wilcoxon test on pairs of BW v NON for each output** ask Zach ab this step
6. Conduct a signed-ranked wilcoxon test to determine which model architecture + dataset combination is best.
